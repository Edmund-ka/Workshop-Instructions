# How to Install Animate.css via CDN

This guide explains how to install Bootstrap in your project using a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

## Step 1: Add Animate CSS to Your Project
First, make sure you have an HTML file where you'll include the animations. You can create one by following these steps:
To include Bootstrap's CSS in your project, add the following `<link>` tag inside the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

```html
<head>
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animate.css/4.1.1/animate.min.css"
  />
</head>

```


## Step 2: Verify Animate.css Installation
```html
<h1 class="animate__animated animate__bounce">An animated element</h1>
```
